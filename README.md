# Python Adventure Game

## Basic Requirements:
- Windows 10
- Python 3.9 or later. Check with ``python --version`` / ``py --version``
- Faster CPU NO LONGER required
- A proper installation of python pip is required for the package manager
to function properly. Check if you can run ``py -m pip --version``

## Setup:
- Keep all files in the **same** directory.
Launch ***main.py*** through python interpreter or command prompt

## Info:
- When the program first opens it will run an initialization script
that will optimize the screen size for your monitor and resize 
the console accordingly. It will also check if all the required
packages are installed, if they aren't it will install them
automatically.

- The program does not currently have a save file... if it closes
**all data** will be lost, and you will start from the beginning.

- The program is made to be modular, meaning if you follow the
format correctly you can add your own weapons, NPCs, enemies, maps,
events, doors, or edit current ones. But let's be honest, this 
program will realistically be deleted or archived after use.
