# Python_Adventure_Game

#### Basic Requirements:
- Windows 10
- Python 3.9 or later
- Faster CPU NO LONGER required

#### Setup:
Put all files in the **same** directory.
Launch ***main.py***

#### Info:
- When the program first opens it will run a intialization script
that will optimize the screen size for your monitor and resize 
the console accordingly. It will also check if all the required
packages are installed, if they aren't it will install them
automatically.

- The program does not currently have a save file... if it closes
**all data** will be lost and you will start from the beginning

- The program is made to be modular, meaning if you follow the
format correctly you can add your own weapons, NPCs, enemies, maps,
events, doors, or edit current ones. But lets be honest, this 
program will realistically be deleted or archived after use.
